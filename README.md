# ✨ Glyph Party

> *Beautiful Unicode Character Search*

A drop-dead gorgeous [Unicode character search](https://glyph-party.wimpys.world/) tool for developers who want to add visual flair to their CLI applications, because your terminal deserves better than boring ASCII. Built with love, powered by cups of tea, and themed with [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) colours 🎨 that'll make your eyes happy.

## 🎭 The Story

Tired of hunting through nightmarish Unicode search websites that look like they were designed in 1995? So was I. After spending way too long trying to find the perfect symbols for a terminal app, I decided enough was enough 👿

**Glyph Party** is what happens when a developer gets fed up with ugly interfaces and decides to build something beautiful instead. It's Unicode search, but ✨*pretty*✨.

## 🚀 What You Get

- **10,000+ carefully curated glyphs** perfect for terminal UIs, no [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) required
- **Instant search** that actually works (shocking, I know)
- **Click to copy** any character (because life's too short for manual selection)
- **Catppuccin Mocha theme** that won't burn your retinas
- **Categories & blocks** for when you know roughly what you want
- **Click for details** including Unicode codes and HTML entities
- **Responsive design** that works on your phone too

## ⚡ Quick Start

### The Lazy Way (Recommended) 💪
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wimpysworld/glyph-party.git
cd glyph-party
just setup    # Installs deps + builds Unicode data
just dev      # Starts server + opens browser
```

### The Manual Way 🤦‍♂️
```bash
npm install
npm run build:data
npm run dev
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 16+, Python 3, and a sense of style.

## 🎨 Features That Spark Joy

### Smart Search
Type `arrow` and get beautiful arrows. Type `heart` and get lovely hearts. Type `math` and get mathematical symbols that would make Euler weep with joy.

### One-Click Copy
Click any character and it's instantly copied to your clipboard. Because in 2025, we shouldn't have to manually select text like cave dwellers.

### Gorgeous Design
Built with the Catppuccin Mocha theme because dark mode is life, and purple is the colour of royalty (and developers with good taste).

### Categories That Make Sense
- Mathematical symbols for your data visualisations
- Arrows for your flow charts
- Hearts for when your code finally works
- Stars for rating systems
- And much, much more

## 🛠️ Just Commands

Using [just](https://github.com/casey/just) because Makefiles are so last decade:

```bash
just setup      # Complete setup for new projects
just dev        # Start development server + open browser
just build      # Generate fresh Unicode data
just stats      # Show project statistics
just check      # Verify everything's working
just help       # When you forget these commands
```

## 🏗️ Built With

- **Vanilla JS** - Because sometimes that where the momentum can be found.
- **Catppuccin Mocha** - For colours that don't hurt
- **Unicode 16.0** - The latest and greatest character database
- **JetBrains Mono** - For that crisp monospace goodness
- **Love and frustration** - The usual developer cocktail
