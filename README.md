## 🎭 The Story

Tired of hunting through nightmarish Unicode search websites that look like they were designed in 1995? So was I. After spending way too long trying to find the perfect symbols for a terminal app, I decided enough was enough 👿

**Glyph Party** is what happens when a developer gets fed up with ugly interfaces tuat are awkward to use and decides to build something better instead. It's Unicode search, but ✨*pretty*✨ and easy to use.

## 🚀 What You Get

- **10,000+ carefully curated glyphs** perfect for terminal UIs, no [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) required
- **Instant search** that actually works (shocking, I know)
- **Click to copy** any character (because life's too short for manual selection)
- **Catppuccin Mocha theme** that won't burn your retinas
- **Categories & blocks** for when you know roughly what you want
- **Click for details** including Unicode codes and HTML entities
- **Responsive design** that works on your phone too

## ⚡ Quick Start

### The Lazy Way (Recommended) 💪
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wimpysworld/glyph-party.git
cd glyph-party
just setup    # Installs deps + builds Unicode data
just dev      # Starts server + opens browser
```

### The Manual Way 🤦‍♂️
```bash
npm install
npm run build:data
npm run dev
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 16+, Python 3, and a sense of style.
